"""Claude Code status line: context window + plan burn-rate projection.

Claude Code pipes a JSON blob to this script on stdin before each render.
Two independent meters live in there, and conflating them is the classic
mistake:

  context_window.*  -- how much the model can currently SEE. Per session.
                       Freed by /clear and /compact.
  rate_limits.*     -- how much you have SPENT against your subscription.
                       Per account. Freed only by the clock.

`rate_limits` is the only programmatic surface for plan consumption; no
slash command emits it in a pipeable form. It appears for Claude.ai
Pro/Max subscribers after the first API response of a session, and either
window may be independently absent. Handle absence, never assume presence.

Schema: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline

Line two additionally leads with the CLAUDE SEAT — which account is answering —
coloured by whether it agrees with the git identity of the folder you're standing
in. See the `claude seat` section below and
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-03-claude-seat-statusline-design.md.

Side effect: throttled append of each sample to ~/.claude/usage-log.jsonl,
building the history that makes week-over-week projection possible.
